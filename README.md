SpaceXpanse Decentralized Applications Development Engine, or DappEngine for short, is a full-featured, no-code, open-source game development software. You can build games for mobile, desktop, and the web. It is fast and easy to use: the game logic is built up using an intuitive and powerful event-based system.

### Main features:

- Objects: In DappEngine, everything on the screen is an object. This includes the playable character, enemies, and parts of the environment.

- Events and Control Flow: DappEngine uses events to define the logic of your game. You can create conditions and actions to control how objects interact and behave.

- Variables: DappEngine allows you to use variables to store and manipulate data during gameplay. This gives you flexibility in creating dynamic and interactive experiences.

- Functions: DappEngine provides a powerful feature called "Events Function" or simply Function. Functions allow you to create your own actions, conditions, or expressions, making it easier to organize and reuse your game's events.

- Ready-to-Use Interface Elements: DappEngine includes a variety of pre-made objects such as buttons, switches, sliders, and more. This saves you time and effort by providing ready-to-use interface elements for your game.

- Extensions: DappEngine features are provided through extensions, allowing you to embed only the features you need in your game. This modular approach gives you flexibility in customizing your game development process.

- Cross-Platform Development: DappEngine is a cross-platform game development software. You can build games for mobile, desktop, and the web, making it easier to reach a wider audience.

- Open-Source and No-Code: DappEngine is an open-source, no-code game development software. It provides a user-friendly interface that doesn't require coding knowledge, making it accessible to beginners and experienced developers alike.

It offers even more advanced features like tilemaps, physics engine, platformer engine, particle emitter, dialogue editor, leaderboards, pathfinding, and gamepad support.

| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Core`        | DappEngine core library, containing common tools to implement the IDE and work with DappEngine games. |
| `GDJS`        | The game engine, written in TypeScript, using PixiJS (WebGL), powering all DappEngine games.        |
| `DappEngine.js` | Bindings of `Core`, `GDJS` and `Extensions` to JavaScript (with WebAssembly), used by the IDE.    |
| `newIDE`      | The game editor, written in JavaScript with React, Electron and PixiJS.                           |
| `Extensions`  | Extensions for the game engine, providing objects, behaviors, events and new features.            |
